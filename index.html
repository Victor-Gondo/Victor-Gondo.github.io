        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Software Engineer (AI team), OSU College Of Business, Corvallis, OR</strong> - March 2024 – June 2024<br>
                During my time as a volunteer in a project where a professor of AI collaborated with the College of Business to develop a student-facing chatbot, I gained invaluable experience in teamwork and accountability. This project had two separate teams working on the chatbot, which fueled my competitive spirit and drive to exceed expectations. I learned the importance of being accountable for my contributions and continuously striving to outperform, all while fostering strong collaboration and communication within my team.

            <li>
                <strong>Mobile Engineer Intern, EdenFarm, Jakarta, Indonesia</strong> - July 2022 – September 2022<br>
                As my first work experience, this internship taught me the significance of not being afraid to ask questions. Initially, I had little knowledge, but by consistently seeking guidance, I rapidly gained the skills needed to contribute effectively within three months. This experience also introduced me to development frameworks like Agile and taught me the nuances of communicating with both clients and consumers from a developer’s perspective. It was a formative experience that emphasized the importance of teamwork and continuous learning.

            <li>
                <strong>Co-Owner, Creased, Seattle, WA</strong> - January 2021 - March 2021<br>
                Running my own e-commerce business, Creased, where I sold shoes, provided me with hands-on experience in the significance of UI design for driving sales. I discovered how a visually appealing and user-friendly website could capture attention and convert it into sales. Additionally, this venture taught me the meaning of self-accountability; if sales were lacking, it was a reflection of my own efforts, which pushed me to continuously improve and innovate.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>CryptoCurrency Trading Bot</strong> - September 2023 - June 2024<br>
                In this project, I worked with a team of four to develop a cryptocurrency trading bot that utilized historical data to speculate on future prices. This experience was a deep dive into resourcefulness, as none of us had extensive AI knowledge at the outset. We had to independently research and learn from academic papers, consult professors, and seek advice from more knowledgeable peers. The project honed my ability to self-learn and apply AI concepts in a real-world context, culminating in a functional trading bot.
